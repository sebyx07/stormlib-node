## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use StormLib-Node:

```javascript
import { Archive } from 'stormlib-node';

// Create a new MPQ archive
const archive = new Archive('new_archive.mpq', { create: true });

// Add a file to the archive
archive.addFile('local_file.txt', 'archived_file.txt');

// Extract a file from the archive
archive.extractFile('archived_file.txt', 'extracted_file.txt');

// List files in the archive
const files = archive.listFiles();
console.log('Files in the archive:', files);

// Don't forget to close the archive when you're done
archive.close();
```

## üìö API
